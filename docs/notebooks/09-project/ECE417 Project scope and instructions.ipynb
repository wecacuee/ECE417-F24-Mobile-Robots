If you have access to other robots, or want to borrow one of the robots from my lab for the project, you are welcome to. The main concepts that we covered in the class, so far, are:\n",

    "1. Planning by Dijkstra, A-star, RRT etc.\n",

    "a. Implement pick and place on a robotic simulator like PyBullet that can avoid obstacles. You must integrate your own inverse kinematics or planning or ROS bindings to demonstrate concepts from this class.\n",
