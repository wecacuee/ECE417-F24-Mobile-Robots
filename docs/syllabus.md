# ECE 417/533: Introduction to Robotics
### Spring 2022
### Vikas Dhiman

## Motivation
The definition of Robots has been a receding definition. Humanoids that can do everything autonomously have always been and still called Robots; but Roombas are just “smart” vacuum cleaners now and Teslas are just Full Self Driving vehicles---no longer Robots. This course focuses on Mobile Robots: the robots like Roombas and Teslas that move around. This is in contrast to Robotic arms installed in factories for automatic production. We will spend a lecture or two on Robotic arms, but there is an entire course dedicated to those: MEE 444. In this course, we will focus on getting a taste of and understanding the basics of a wide range of Robotics technology, using the open-source Robotic Operating Systems (ROS) framework as an entry point. ROS supports many programming languages, including Python and C++. We will cover basic algorithms for robotic Perception (understanding the world around the robot), Planning and control (taking action on the world to achieve a desired outcome).

## Prerequisite:
